    "* Our software package computes gradients by leveraging the technique of automatic differentiation. Before we can understand automatic differentiation, we must first describe and motivate the importance of differentiation itself. Finding the derivative of a function measures the sensitivity to change of a function value with respect to a change in its input argument. Derivatives are not only essential in calculus applications like numerically solving differential equations and optimizing and solving linear systems, but are useful in many real world, scientific settings. For example, differentiation is essential in analyzing the profit and loss of a company's business or finding the minimum amount of material to construct a building.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* To perform differentiation, two different approaches are solving the task symbolically or numerically computing the derivatives. Symbolic differentation yields accurate answers, however depending on the complexity of the function, it could be expensive to evaluate and result in inefficient code. On the other hand, numerically computing derivatives is less expensive, however it suffers from potential issues with numerical stability and a loss of accuracy.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automatic differentiation overcomes the shortcomings of both the symbolic and numerical approach. Automatic differentiation is less costly than symbolic differentiation, but evaluates derivatives at machine precision. The technique leveages both forward mode and backward mode and evaluates each step with the results of previous computations or values. As a result of this, automatic differentiation avoids finding the entire analytical expresssion to compute the derivative and is hence iteratively evaluating a gradient based on input values. Thus, based on these key advantages, our library implements and performs forward mode automatic differentiation to efficiently and accurately compute derivatives."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. __Directory Structure:__\n",
    "   * 1a. We include our project directory structure in the image below. Our package is called _AHJZ_autodiff_, where our code for automatic differentiation lies within \"AHJZ_autodiff\", our milestone documentation lies within \"docs\", all unit testing files are located in \"testing\", and the root of the directory holds our readme, license, and requirements.txt file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * 1b. Directory structure layout: ![auto_diff_project_directory_structure.png](attachment:auto_diff_project_directory_structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. __Modules:__\n",
    "   * 2a. _functions.py_: This file contains sixteen methods to compute the function and derivative values of the elementary operations outlined below. These functions form the partial computational pieces required to perform automatic differentiation. The sixteen elementary functions are the following: '+', '-', '*' '/', 'sqrt(x)', 'power(x,n)', 'exp(x)', 'log(x, b)', 'ln(x)', 'sin(x)', 'cos(x)', 'tan(x)', 'cot(x)', 'csc(x)', 'sec(x)'.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * 2b. _forward_mode.py_: This file computes the gradient using automatic differentiation forward mode. A user is required to input the function they are interested in computing the derivative of and the point or vector at which the derivative is to be evaluated at.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * 2c. _fast_forward_mode.py_ (extension module): This file will contain our extension to the basic automatic differentiation functionality. In this module we compute the gradient using an efficient version of forward mode of automatic differentation by using an efficient graph data structure and optimized tree traversal. A user is required to input the function they are interested in computing the derivative of and the point or vector at which the derivative is to be evaluated at. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. __Test Suite Location:__\n",
    "   * 3a. The test suite will live in the \"testing\" directory which is a subdirectory found off the root directory (see 1. Directory Structure). The \"testing\" directory will contain all unit tests for our different modules. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   * 3b. To ensure our testing procedure has complete code coverage, we will leverage CodeCov. CodeCov will enable us to quickly understand which lines are being executed in our test cases. Moreover, we will make use of TravisCI in order to see which of our unit tests are passing/failing. \n",
    "    \n",

    "#### 5. __Packaging the Software:__\n",
    "   * 5a. The software will be packaged using PyScaffold, which is a key builder for Python packages regarding data science. We plan on using this framework for packaging as it enables us to maintain and upgrade our package using templates and ready-to-use configurations to improve and further develop our program with newer versions of Python and external library dependencies. Moreover, we will use readthedocs to document, build, and host our documentation automatically. With readthedocs, if we were to upgrade the package to new versions, it would seemlessly update our documentation accordingly.\n",

    "#### 6. __Other Considerations: Package Dependencies__\n",
    "   * 6a. The only library dependency our package will rely on is numpy. We design our software this way to ensure that we are not creating multiple external dependencies and thereby increase our software's reliability .\n"

    "#### 1.  __Core Data Structure:__\n",
    "   * 1a. Our primary core data structure is going to be a dictionary to store each node in the computational graph that uses the tangent trace and primal trace to compute the partial differentiation and function value for a specific variable. More specifically, the keys would be the node of the computational graph (state name) and the values are going to be a tuple that holds the associated operation at the specific state (function value and derivative).  \n",

This module will generalize each of the functions in order to handle both scalar and vector input. Each method will take in as an input a vector or scalar value stored at the previous node in the computational graph and output the derivative value and function value for that elementary function. We can then store the methods' outputs as a tuple in the computational graph dictionary alongside its primal and tangent traces. \n",
