Code

	⁃	implement comparison operators in the val_derv class (less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, equal to, not equal to)
	⁃	implement logistic function 
	⁃	change the error message in the power function (since its similar to online code)
	⁃	rearrange some of the function order in val_derv() (since its similar to online code)
	⁃	 add comments to ALL CODE
	⁃	add docstrings for the extensions 

Testing 

	⁃	set up GitHub Actions to accommodate CI requirements
	⁃	add testing code for ALL VECTOR CASES
	⁃	add a couple test cases for embedded functions
	⁃	add testing script for all optimizers 

Documentation 

	⁃	update background section 
	⁃	(add a small section for each optimizer)
	⁃	update “How to use” package section
	⁃	 avoid using numpy and instead show the user how they can build input functions using OUR val_derv class
	⁃	update “how to use” package section to include optimizer use cases
	⁃	update the how to install section to include where/how to install optimizers module
	⁃	update “introduction”
	⁃	include small section on optimizer extra features (why optimizers are important)
	⁃	update software organization

	⁃	update directory structure  + image
	⁃	answer question of “Should developers and consumers follow a different installation procedure?”
	⁃	update implementation details:
	⁃	extension needs to be described, additional information/background on extension, and any math/background for extension 
	⁃	see milestone guidelines to see what else to include here
	⁃	ADD a future section
	⁃	see milestone guidelines for what to include
	⁃	Add a broader impact and inclusively statement
